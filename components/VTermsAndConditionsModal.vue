          Subscriptions
          <ol>
            <li>
              Once you have created your Account, you may choose a Subscription.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Subscriptions we offer will be set out on our Platform,
              including details of each Subscription’s features and limitations,
              Subscription Fees and Subscription Periods.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the Subscription Period, you will be billed for the
              Subscription Fees on a recurring basis, as set out on our Platform
              (<strong>Billing Cycle</strong>).
            </li>
            <li>
              Your Subscription can be upgraded or downgraded at any time
              through your Account. Any upgrades to your Subscription will take
              effect immediately (and you will be charged the difference between
              your current Subscription and your new Subscription on a pro-rata
              basis). Any downgrades to your Subscription will take effect from
              the beginning of the next Billing Cycle.
            </li>
            <li>
              You will be billed for any Subscription Fees due at the beginning
              of each Billing Cycle. Our payments methods will be set out on our
              Platform. If you choose to pay your Subscription Fees using one of
              our third-party payment processors, you may need to accept their
              terms and conditions (if this is the case, these will be set out
              on our Platform).
            </li>
            <li>
              You must not pay, or attempt to pay, any Subscription Fees by
              fraudulent or unlawful means. If you make payment by debit or
              credit card, you must be the authorised card holder. If payment is
              made by direct debit, by providing your bank account details and
              accepting these Terms, you authorise our nominated third-party
              payment processor to debit your bank account in accordance with
              your chosen Subscription, and you confirm that you are either the
              holder or an authorised signatory of that bank account.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cancellation:</strong> Your Subscription continues for the
              Subscription Period, and at the end of each Subscription Period,
              provided you have paid all Subscription Fees owing, your
              Subscription will be automatically renewed for recurring monthly
              periods (each of which will be considered a Subscription Period).
              If you wish to cancel your Subscription, you may do so through
              your Account. Your cancellation will take effect at the end of
              your current Subscription Period, and your Subscription will not
              be renewed (meaning you will need to continue paying all
              Subscription Fees due up until your current Subscription Period
              ends).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Late Payments:</strong> If any Subscription Fees are not
              paid on time, we may:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  suspend your access our Services (including access to our
                  Platform); and
                </li>
                <li>
                  charge interest on any overdue payments at a rate equal to the
                  Reserve Bank of Australia’s cash rate, from time-to-time, plus
                  2% per annum, calculated daily and compounding monthly.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Taxes:</strong> You are responsible for paying any levies
              or taxes associated with your use of our Services, for example
              sales taxes, value-added taxes or withholding taxes (unless we are
              required by law to collect these on your behalf).

              Platform (which may be suspended or revoked in accordance with
              these Terms). This right cannot be passed on or transferred to any
              other person and, if you have a Subscription, will also be subject
              to the conditions of your Subscription (as set out on our Platform

              You acknowledge and agree that because of the nature of the
              internet, the processing and transmission of Your Data by us may
              occur over various networks.
            </li>
            <li>
              You are responsible for (meaning we are not liable for):
              <ol>
                <li>
                  the integrity of Your Data on your systems, networks or any

              When you use our Services, we may create anonymised statistical
              data from Your Data and usage of our Services (for example,
              through aggregation). Once anonymised, we own that data and may
              use it for our own purposes, such as to provide and improve our
              Services, to develop new services or product offerings, to
              identify business trends, and for other uses we communicate to
              you. This may include making such anonymised data publicly
              available, provided it is not compiled using a sample size small
              enough to make underlying portions of Your Data identifiable.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you do not provide Your Data to us, it may impact your ability

            <li>
              While using our Services, you may share confidential information
              with us, and you may become aware of confidential information
              about us. You agree not to use our confidential information, and
              to take reasonable steps to protect our confidential information
              from being disclosed without our permission, and we agree to do
              the same for your confidential information. This also means making
              sure that any employees, contractors, professional advisors or
              agents of ours or yours only have access to confidential
              information on a ‘need-to-know basis’ (in other words, the
              disclosure is absolutely necessary), and that they also agree to
              not misuse or disclose such confidential information.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, either you or we may share confidential information with
              legal or regulatory authorities if required by law to do so.

              We collect, hold and disclose and use any Personal Information you

            </li>
            <li>
              You must only disclose Personal Information to us if you have the

            </li>
            <li>
              We may need to disclose Personal Information to third parties,

              example, IT and administrative service providers and our
              professional advisors).

          Consumer Law Rights

            <li>
              In some jurisdictions, you may have guarantees, rights or other
              remedies provided by law (<strong>Consumer Law Rights</strong>),
              and these Terms do not restrict your Consumer Law Rights. We will
              only be bound by your Consumer Law Rights and the express wording
              of these Terms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Subject to your Consumer Law Rights, we do not provide a refund
              for a change of mind or change in circumstance.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you accept these Terms in Australia, nothing in these Terms
              should be interpreted to exclude, restrict or modify the
              application of, or any rights or remedies you may have under, any
              part of the Australian Consumer Law (as set out in Schedule 2 of
              the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth)). If our Platform is
              not ordinarily used for personal, household or domestic use, our
              liability for a breach of your Consumer Law Rights is limited to
              either resupplying our Services, or paying the cost of having our
              Services resupplied.

              To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for,
              and you release us from liability for, any Liability caused or
              contributed to by, arising from or in connection with:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  your computing environment (for example, your hardware,

                </li>

                <li>
                  neither we or you are liable for any Consequential Loss;

                <li>
                  a party’s liability for any Liability under these Terms will
                  be reduced proportionately to the extent the relevant
                  Liability was caused or contributed to by the actions (or
                  inactions) of the other party, including any failure by the

                <li>
                  (where our Services are not ordinarily acquired for personal,

                  failure by us to comply with relevant Consumer Law Rights, our
                  Liability is limited (at our discretion) to supplying the
                  Services again or paying the cost of having the Services
                  supplied again; and

                  our aggregate liability to you for any Liability arising from

                  amount of any Subscription Fees paid by you to us in respect
                  of the supply of the relevant Services to which the Liability
                  relates, or if you do not have a Subscription, to AU$1,000.

              Apple and Apple subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of

              You hereby represent and warrant that: (1) you are not located in

          Suspension and Termination
          <ol>
            <li>
              We may suspend your access to our Services where we reasonably
              believe there has been any unauthorised access to or use of our
              Services (such as the unauthorised sharing of login details for
              our Platform). If we suspend your access to our Services, we will
              let you know within a reasonable time of doing so, and we will
              work with you to resolve the matter, or if it cannot be resolved,
              then we may terminate your Account and your access to our Services
              will end.
            </li>
            <li>
              We may terminate these Terms (meaning you will lose access to our

              will be cancelled) if:
              <ol>

                  you fail to pay your Subscription Fees when they are due;

                  you experience an insolvency event (including but not limited

                  we breach these Terms and do not remedy that breach within 14

              take effect at the end of your current Subscription Period.
            </li>
            <li>
              Upon termination of these Terms, we will retain Your Data

            </li>
            <li>
              Termination of these Terms will not affect any other rights or

              party.

              (<strong>Dispute</strong>) unless we and you first meet (in good
              faith) to resolve the Dispute. Nothing in this clause will operate
              to prevent us or you from seeking urgent injunctive or equitable
              relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. If the Dispute is
              not resolved at that initial meeting:

              <strong>Events Outside Our Control:</strong> We will not be liable
              for any delay or failure to perform our obligations (including our
              Services), if such delay or failure is caused or contributed to by
              an event or circumstance beyond our reasonable control.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Governing law:</strong> These Terms are governed by the

              <strong>Nature of Legal Relationship:</strong> These Terms do not

              <strong>Third Party Sites:</strong> Our Platform may contain links
